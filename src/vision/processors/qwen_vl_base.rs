//! Shared base implementation for Qwen VL family image processors.
//!
//! This module provides a generic processor that handles the common logic
//! for Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL, and Qwen3-VL models. The specific variants
//! differ only in their default parameters (patch_size, normalization values).
//!
//! # Processing Pipeline
//!
//! 1. Validate aspect ratio (must be < 200:1)
//! 2. Smart resize to fit within min/max pixel bounds
//! 3. Align dimensions to (patch_size * merge_size) boundary
//! 4. Convert to tensor and normalize
//! 5. Reshape into patches for the vision encoder
//!
//! # Token Calculation
//!
//! ```text
//! grid_t = 1  (for images, temporal dimension is 1)
//! grid_h = resized_height / patch_size
//! grid_w = resized_width / patch_size
//! num_tokens = (grid_t * grid_h * grid_w) / merge_size²
//! ```
